// combo (ActionEffectHandler) must query before firing. Combo routes (Gnashing Fang etc.) use

// (Hakaze->Gyofu, Split Shot->Heated Split Shot) is pressed as the upgraded id, but the
// sheet records combos against the base id — adjusting both sides makes them match
// regardless of which form the game stored, so upgraded chains combo like any other.
