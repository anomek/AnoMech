## Traits
| Trait | Status | Note |
|-------|:------:|------|
| Dualcast | ✅ | Buff granted on cast completion; consumed by any non-ability action (Acceleration-reduced casts excepted). The next spell is made instant by answering the client's cast-time query. |

## Role actions
Addle, Sleep, Lucid Dreaming, Surecast — ➖. Swiftcast ✅ (167 → next spell instant; priority Acceleration → Dualcast → Swiftcast).

## Not simulated
- **Unbalanced mana** — White/Black clamp independently; the |White − Black| > 30 penalty (lower colour generates at half rate) and crystal recolour are unmodelled (`// TODO`).
- **Conditional proc guarantees** — procs roll their flat chance (Verthunder III/Veraero III/Impact 50%, Verflare/Verholy 20%) even where the game guarantees 100%: while Acceleration is up, and (for Verflare/Verholy) when the opposite mana colour is higher.
